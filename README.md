# Skin_Consultation_Manager

The Skin Consultation Manager System is a Java application built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It allows you to manage doctors and their details, book consultations for patients, and securely store patient disease information. The system provides a Java Swing GUI for easy interaction and visualization of doctor details and consultation bookings.
Features

    Store Doctor Details: The system saves the doctor details, including their medical license number and phone number, and stores them in a text file for future reference.
    
    Book Consultations: Users can book consultations by providing patient details, such as name, time, and date, along with the desired doctor for the consultation.
    
    Secure Patient Disease Information: The system ensures that patient disease information is encrypted for security purposes. Only authorized personnel can access and view this information.
